JavaScripts
===========

All my JavaScripts for Photoshop (well not reallly)

I currently have 1354 JSX files containing 34,214,724 bytes.

They are all not ready for public consumption.

There are a lot of duplicates. (versioning by duplicating)

There are a lot of them that I can't share because they are not mine.

There are some that expose bugs in Photoshop for various versions that we have fixed.

Some of them are interesting and some I use daily. Those are the ones I want to share.
